#####Questions:
The largest species is Ursus spelaeus, also known as a cave bear.
It live in the Pleistocene, going extinct approximately 24,000 years ago.

What does this show about cytochrome-b for the bears?

The cytochrome-b gene is most likely highly conserved among bears most likely because the sequence varies 
very little even though these bears vary quite a bit in mass and at least one of them is extinct.
